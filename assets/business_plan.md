## Business Plan Request for Comments

### Overview

Project Essembly (codename) is a POS system that has enterprise-level features using state-of-the-art technology.   

It's goal is to provide an easy to use, accessible, possibly free, point-of-sales system that can let users and companies easily integrate with the food-service industry, especially delivery.

### Business Assumptions

1. We need a large effort around adoption in order for the project to proceeed.  Even if it is open source, marketing and brand recognition are import aspects of success.
2. We need an excellent team to build it.  Some of the technologies (blockchain and cryto-currency, Rust, etc.) are challenging. The scope is beyond 1 or 2 developers and we also need designers, documentation writers, dev/ops, pm's, ui/ux, and qa resources.
3. We would benefit from additional advisors, including professionals in the retail and food-services industries.
4. We need to provide incentives for participants in the project.  Any team members who are involved should have motivation to stay involved and it should be sufficient to sustain their interest if the project is successful. 
5. We are aiming for a long-term success.  Time and effort will be spent up-front to build something remarkable, but commercialization of product and/or services will be mid to long term.  

###  Team / Business Structure for Discussion

Our past experience shows that there is normally initial enthusiasm, but that it diminishes over time.  Having attempted product and services development in the past, the main prob1ems have been:

1. existing 'work', 
2. other personal projects, 
3. lack of direction and planning, 
4. poor communication, 
5. lack of external partners 

How do we structure a business/project so that we minimize the risk of these problems? 

Scenario #1:

12 month Plan

A first, open-source release is targeted for 5 months from kick-off.  Additional releases occur over the next 7 months, with ~2-3 more releases.  
The business makes no money in the first 14 months and targets 1000 clients in those first 12 months using an open-source model.  
After 12 months, the participants vote for/against continuation and discuss the next model.

This assumes that if additional capitilization will be required at that time. 

All participants should have a stake in the success of the project and most are full-time employees 100% dedicated to the project.  

 - Establish a separate business (U.S. / Singpaore / HK for IP) and give all participants some stake in the effort (shares) that are vested based on some metrics (time/etc.)  For example, a Singapore company is established and participants get shares vested quarterly over 36 months.  
 
If 100,000 shares are the initial issue, with a capitilization of $200,000 USD:

40,000 shares are available for purchase by investors at $5/share.

Assuming the intial team requires 10 full-time participants:

Vesting over 3 years:

1. Owner CEO / Poduct Owner:  20,000 shares vesting 833 per quarter.  (unsalaried - full-time)
2. CTO / Development Manager: 20,000 shares vesting 833 per quarter.  (unsalaried - full-time)
3. Senior Engineer I: 4,000 shares vesting 333 per quarter. (base salary ~3500  USD / month)
4. Senior Engineer II: 3,000 shares vesting 250 per quarter. (base salary ~2500 USD / month)
5. Project Manager: 3,000 shares vesting 250 per quarter. (base salary ~2000 USD / month)
6. UI/UX Developer: 2,000 shares vesting 166 per quarter. (base salary ~2000 USD / month)
7. Lead Developer in Test: 2,000 shares vesting 166 per quarter. (base salary ~1500 USD / month)
8. Developer in Test: 1,500 shares vesting 166 per quarter. (base salary ~1500 USD / month)
9. Designer: 1,000 shares vesting 83 per quarter. (base salary ~1500 USD / month)
10. Technical Writer: 500 shares vesting 41 per quarter. (base salary ~1000 USD / month) (1/2 time)
11. Board of Advisor I: 500 shares vesting 41 per quarter. (unsalaried) (quarterly Skype meetings to discuss and review releases)
12. Board of Advisor II: 500 shares vesting 41 per quarter. (unsalaried) (quarterly Skype meetings to discuss and review releases)
13. Board of Advisor III: 500 shares vesting 41 per quarter. (unsalaried) (quarterly Skype meetings to discuss and review releases)
14. Board of Advisor IV: 500 shares vesting 41 per quarter. (unsalaried) (quarterly Skype meetings to discuss and review releases)

Totals: 
    - 19667 year one vested shares - vesting 4917 quarterly
    - $15,500 / month in salaries for $186,000 annually

Questions / Remarks:

1) What about other contributors?
2) How to measure performance and evaluate?
3) Are the incentives sufficient for ?
4) Other over-head? 
5) It would be beneficial to have an additional resource specializing in subject-mater (e.g. accounting, inventory, etc.) 
6) What about hardware?  Proto-type year-one?
7) UI is critical, so perhaps increasing the budget for that effort makes sense. 
8) Can shares be issued to open-source contributors?  (contributor send PR, request is approved and N shares are allocated based on their effort - what about disputes?  (my code was rejected but the accepted code was a copy of my code!)) 
9) Does an ICO make more sense?
10) Localization
