## Product Essembly 

“An Open-Source POS”

### Intro & Goal

Our goal is to make Essembly a state-of-the-art, free point-of-sales system, with features currently only available in high-end commercial products.  Essembly can be used by any business that sells product or services, including food and beverage establishments.  


### Who’s it for?

There are 3 tiers of clients:

1. Small businesses running an point of sales with simple requirements.
2. Restaurants that need an F&B solution.
3. Enterprises that need support for multiple locations.

### Why build it?

1. There are no good open-source POS solutions.  Because POS systems are generally perceived as commodity items, there's little attention given to the market.  Consequently, small to medium sized businesses rarely have access to state-of-the-art features and struggle with configuration, integrations, and upgrades.  Such businesses increasingly rely on tight integration with delivery services, but manage it by having mobile solutions run side-by-side with POS systems and manually inputing data. 

2. The market is deeply fragmented.  There's an opportunity for consolidation.


### What is it?

Essembly is a high-performance, low-cost, POS solution.  A minimal configuration would be an Android phone running the open-source software.
